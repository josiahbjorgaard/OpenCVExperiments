# OpenCV Experiments

These are some fun experiments using opencv-python with a webcam to do some useful and artistic projects. The included python apps are:

* A motion detecting grid of springy balls [spring_points.py]
* Motion detection of edges (sticky balls) [edge_sticker.py]
* One ball that you can push with motion [ball_game.py]
* Motion detecting video capture (security cam) [MotionDetector.py]
* An artistic mashup of recorded and live video [bgsub.py]
<hr/>

## Useage

Make sure you have the required python packages installed and run the python source file. This shoudl open a window that displays interactive images capured from you webcam.

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.x
* opencv-python
* numpy

### Set-up
Install the prerequisites, run the python source.
If you have conda installed, here are the commands to set-up the environment. The scripts are old, so you have to use old python and opencv
```
conda create -n python2 python=2.7 anaconda
conda activate python2
pip install opencv-python==4.2.0.32

```

### Run
python [sourcefile]
